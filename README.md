# URL-PEELER

This tool basically peels back a URL and checks to see if it's suspicious or not. I wrote it in Python so it should work fine on any OS/Platform that has the most recent version of Python installed. 

As always, I cannot ensure that this will work 100% of the time. It's up to you to use your common sense when it comes to clicking on links. If it looks too good to be true, that's because it probably is. 

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/realmjh/url-peeler.git
cd url-peeler
```

## Usage

```bash
python3 url_peeler.py
```
